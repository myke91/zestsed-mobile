        <h2>WHY US</h2>
        <p>The SPINE effect</p>

        <p>
            Members of our noble communities are privileged to enjoy our Well-Thought-Out SPINE effects,
            a lasting experience that grows with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>S- SECURITY</b> is an integral element of our environment that provides the peace of mind to nurture the
            investor in you with zest, and the assurance that quotas are entrusted in the cares of reputable
            and trustworthy financial brands. Members gain confidence since they are empowered to psychologically,
            emotionally and most importantly financially prepare, for a stress-free future.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>P- PRIORITY</b> informs our decision to gain financial knowledge to secure the future. Our communities
            therefore inspire a proactive culture of managing your personal financial lifestyle. We are
            more concerned about how you consciously develop the habit of ‘Invest Before you Spend’ to
            \'Buy Interest\'; eliminating the "Hand-To-Mouth" lifestyle. Financial freedom requires discipline
            and we at <b>ZESTSED</b> help each other make it a <b>PRIORITY</b>, to consciously channel our financial
            resources into productive use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I- INVESTING</b> is the <b>NEW BOLD</b>. A step your future self will thank you for. Depending solely on your
            pension benefits for retirement won\'t be enough. Unless your company offers a sizable pension
            plan, you will probably need to start spending prudently to invest early. <b>ZESTSED</b> makes it
            easier for you to understand the need to Invest early: by instilling The Learning By Doing
            attitude. Because we know that your invested income can cater for your living expense,
            supplement other activities for a comfortable Retirement or towards achieving your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>N- NETWORKING</b> is core to us because it exposes our communities to a vast pool of knowledge from
            professionals, students and entrepreneurs across different industries, allowing them to
            increase their contacts for growth. Our members reach out to industry experts as well as
            the broader finance and investment world through our annual networking seminars, and summits
            organized. At the Zest Side of Life we strongly believe that <b>‘Your Network Today Will Grow
            your Networth Tomorrow’</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>E- EMPOWERMENT</b> at the Zest Side of life is a priceless boost and knowledge gained that increases
            your financial intelligence. Our communities are a blend of smart brains across diverse
            backgrounds with different work profiles and exposures. It therefore offers each member an
            opportunity to learn and benefit from the wealth of experience via our weekly <b>Knowledge
            Sharing Sessions (KSS)</b>. An experience that challenges your way of thinking and keeps you
            informed.
        </p>
        ☺ Congrats <b>Wealth Creator!</b> You\'ve Got Your <b>Financial SPINE</b> Covered 👍
